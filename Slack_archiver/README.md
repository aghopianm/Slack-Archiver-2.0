# Slack-Archiver-2.0

Slack Archiver that works around the free-use limits of Slack. After 10,000 messages on Slack's free accounts, the platform does not let you access previous messages.

To workaround this, I have created an archiver that stores messages in a SQL database and also saves to a JSON file for permanent storage.
